# Web Design Assignment: Contact Page Update and CSS Integration

## 1. Peer Review Reflection

The peer review went smoothly and was helpful in seeing how others approached their webpages using CSS. It was easier to keep track of my participation with this format because of the structured deadlines and clear expectations. Through the discussion, I noticed that many classmates refined their webpages by improving layout consistency, using CSS to better organize content visually, and enhancing accessibility with more thoughtful color contrast. A lot of them experimented with new techniques like hover effects, gradient backgrounds, or responsive design features, which inspired me to push the design of my own site further. One area where I could use more guidance is applying advanced CSS positioning in a way that’s both visually appealing and mobile-friendly.

## 2. Page Focus

**contact.html**

This week, I focused on building and styling the `contact.html` page to match the overall aesthetic of my site and maintain consistency with my forum page.

## 3. Required Techniques (Must Have)

- ✅ **External CSS Style Sheet**: I linked `style/styles.css` to the new contact page to ensure it follows the styling of the rest of the website.
- ✅ **Class Selector**: Used the `.contact` class to apply specific styling for the contact container, improving spacing, font, and readability.
- ✅ **ID Selector**: Used `#name` and `#message` for form elements to apply individual styles if needed in future development.

## 4. Additional Techniques (At Least Three)

- ✅ **Different Background Colors**: The background color of the body was set to a light shade (`#f0f8ff`), and the nav bar uses a rich green (`#2e8b57`) to draw attention and provide a calming, nature-inspired aesthetic.
- ✅ **Different Font Colors**: Headings and links are styled with contrasting colors to increase readability and visual hierarchy.
- ✅ **Text Alignment**: The text inside the `.contact` section is aligned for clarity, with centered headings and justified body text where appropriate.
- ✅ **Borders and Shadows**: The form and section containers use subtle borders and a thicker box-shadow for readability and visual separation from the background.
- ✅ **Hover Effects**: Links and buttons change appearance on hover, adding interactivity and accessibility.

This documentation reflects my learning and application of new CSS concepts to create a cohesive and accessible web design across all pages, including the new contact page.
