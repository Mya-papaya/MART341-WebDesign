# Sustainable Eats Website

## Description
"Sustainable Eats" is a website designed to promote eco-friendly recipes, reduce food waste, and encourage sustainable eating practices. The website allows users to submit their own recipes, explore featured recipes, and learn more about the impact of food waste. It is structured with a homepage, a recipe submission page, and a featured recipe page showcasing a delicious vegetarian lasagna.

## Features
- **Homepage (index.html)**: Welcomes users with a brief description of the site, links to featured recipes, and encourages users to submit their own sustainable recipes.
- **Recipe Submission Page (recipes.html)**: A form to submit a sustainable recipe, along with an embedded table of food waste statistics to educate users.
- **Featured Recipe Page (featured.html)**: Displays a featured recipe, in this case, a vegetarian lasagna, complete with a link to the full recipe page.
- **Navigation**: Links between pages allow users to easily navigate between the homepage, the recipe submission form, and the featured recipe.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Used for creating the structure and content of the website.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for visual enhancement, including background color, image styling, and responsive design.
- **Mailto Form**: Allows users to submit their recipes via email.
  
## What I'm Most Proud Of
I am most proud of the overall design and functionality of the website. I carefully selected a color scheme that reflects sustainability and incorporated intuitive navigation. The recipe submission form is straightforward and easy to use, and Iâ€™m pleased with how the layout makes it easy for users to both contribute their recipes and view featured content. Additionally, I made sure to include relevant food waste statistics, which I believe add meaningful context to the website's mission.

## Reflection on the Project
This project has been a great learning experience in web development, particularly in integrating forms, creating clean and readable CSS, and ensuring that the content is both accessible and functional. I enjoyed the process of designing the layout, selecting images, and considering the user experience.

Right now, things are going well, and I feel confident in the work I've done. The one thing I would like to improve in the future is to include a backend system for managing recipe submissions and featured content. Additionally, I would love to add more interactivity, such as rating recipes or adding a search feature.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing a backend for dynamic recipe submissions.
- Adding an interactive feature to rate recipes.
- Improving the visual aesthetics with more advanced CSS and animations.
