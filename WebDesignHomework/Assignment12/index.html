            <h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather Your Materials: Choose artist-grade paints, brushes, a canvas, palette knives, and mediums like linseed oil or gamsol.</li>
                <li>Prepare Your Workspace: Set up in a ventilated area with good lighting, and lay protective sheets to avoid spills.</li>
                <li>Prime Your Canvas: Apply a thin layer of gesso and let it dry. Sand lightly if desired for a smoother surface.</li>
                <li>Sketch Your Design: Plan your composition with pencil or charcoal, focusing on proportions and placement.</li>
                <li>Apply an Underpainting: Use a thinned neutral color to set tonal values and mood for your painting.</li>
                <li>Block In Main Shapes: Start with larger elements and background layers, then gradually build up the painting.</li>
                <li>Add Details and Texture: Use smaller brushes and palette knives for fine details and depth. Experiment with stippling or scraping techniques.</li>
                <li>Blend and Harmonize Colors: Work wet-on-wet for smooth transitions, blending edges softly for natural effects.</li>
                <li>Final Touches: Add highlights and vibrant accents to complete the painting. Check for balance from a distance.</li>
                <li>Clean and Store: Clean brushes thoroughly, store paints securely, and let the painting dry for at least two weeks before varnishing.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Expanded Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consistency Matters:</strong> Start with thin layers and progress to thicker ones for stable, crack-free painting.</li>
                <li><strong>Mix Thoughtfully:</strong> Avoid over-mixing colors on your palette to maintain vibrancy.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay Patient:</strong> Allow paint to dry between layers for cleaner results and better blending.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> Work in a ventilated area, especially when using solvents or varnishes.</li>
                <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> Try different mediums like linseed oil or gamsol to discover unique textures and effects.</li>
