# README for Assignment 12

**HTML Page Worked On:** `contact.html`

## Techniques Implemented

For this assignment, I focused on integrating a **Contact Page** and refining the overall **CSS** for a more polished and user-friendly design.

### 1. **Contact Page**
- I created a new **Contact Page** that includes a clean and simple contact form. Users can enter their name, email, and a message. I styled it to match the overall theme of my site, using soft rounded corners and clean fonts to make it approachable and easy to use.

### 2. **CSS Updates**
- I updated my CSS to make the design feel more cohesive and visually appealing. I made a bunch of small tweaks that added up to a cleaner look and smoother user experience.

## Why These Changes Were Made
- I wanted to add a way for users to interact with me through the site, so the Contact Page was a must.
- The CSS updates were mainly about polishing everything—making sure colors, spacing, and layouts all felt intentional and easy to navigate.

The website features sections like tutorials, a gallery of artwork, tools, media, and now a **Contact Page**. The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility and ease of use. The design includes playful elements, like emojis, to create a fun and engaging user experience.
